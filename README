This is the 2.5.x branch of the Common Service, incorporating SakaiPerson.

This is not an official 2.5.x branch as this project was introduced after 2.5 was finalised. 
However, a 2.5 branch of the common project was required so this branch was created.

Ordinarily you will not need this, unless a specific project you are buulding has called for it.
